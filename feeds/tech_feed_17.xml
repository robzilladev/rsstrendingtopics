      <description><![CDATA[The request is open to both national labs and private firms, and NASA plans to choose roughly four proposals.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833269&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NASA knows that liquid hydrogen fuel and lithium batteries can&#8217;t pack enough power to send ships and astronauts record distances from Earth. The agency <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/nasa-looks-to-go-beyond-batteries-for-space-exploration/#.U0Wq5a1dWS8">announced today</a> that it will offer up to $250,000 for battery alternatives it can use for Earth and deep-space missions.</p>
<p>The funds come as a part of NASA&#8217;s plans to invest over the next 18 months in technologies &#8220;that address several high priority challenges for achieving safe and affordable deep-space exploration,&#8221; associate administrator for space technology Michael Gazarik said in <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/nasa-looks-to-go-beyond-batteries-for-space-exploration/#.U0Wq5a1dWS8">a statement</a>. NASA expects to choose roughly four proposals divided into two categories: improvements on battery features like cell chemistry packaging and cell integration, and technologies that surpass lithium batteries&#8217; theorized limits altogether.</p>
<p>The Department of Energy <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/team-led-argonne-national-lab-selected-doe-s-batteries-and-energy-storage-hub">plans to pour</a> $120 million into U.S. labs, universities and private companies between 2012 and 2017 for battery development. And while <a href="http://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</a>&#8211;the effort&#8217;s hub&#8211;<a href="http://www.anl.gov/articles/arpa-e-awards-iit-argonne-team-34-million-breakthrough-battery-technology">has already unveiled</a> several promising battery developments, the competition will also be an interesting opportunity for private firms to get involved. Elon Musk&#8217;s Tesla and SpaceX, for example, have poured a lot of time and money into the lithium batteries that power their cars and rockets, and are undoubtedly looking into other technologies.</p>
<p>My colleague Katie Fehrenbacher <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/03/04/5-things-to-know-about-how-teslas-huge-battery-factory-will-effect-the-power-grid/">wrote last month</a> that there is already a rich range of alternatives to batteries for energy storage. There are compressed air batteries and systems that pump water to the top of a hill and let it run back down to generate electricity. Some make much more sense for Earth than space, but they all show that energy storage is not just on NASA&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>Whatever battery alternatives are chosen will complement ongoing initiatives to reduce NASA&#8217;s reliance on liquid fuel, which is finite and expensive to carry into space. Some of its spacecraft already use solar energy. The <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/technology/technologiesofbroadbenefit/power/">Curiosity rover</a>, which landed on Mars in 2012, carries a tiny nuclear reactor in its belly. And there are already proposals to turn the moon and other planets into fueling outposts, where robots could mine resources and refuel docked spacecraft.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Founder Mark Armstrong started Longreads as a Twitter hashtag five years ago and built it into a global community focused on longform writing. The startup said Wednesday that it has been acquired by Automattic, the company behind the WordPress blogging platform.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833281&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Longreads, which <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/08/05/the-short-story-of-longreads-according-to-founder-mark-armstrong/">started with a Twitter hashtag</a> and gradually evolved into a community of readers sharing longform fiction and journalism, said on Wednesday that <a href="http://blog.longreads.com/post/longreads-is-joining-the-automattic-family/">it has been acquired by Automattic</a> (see disclosure below), the for-profit company behind the WordPress.com blogging platform. WordPress founder and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg said that Longreads&#8217; commitment to longform reading fits perfectly with his company&#8217;s desire to promote good content and that all four of Longreads&#8217; employees would be joining Automattic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world cannot live on 140 characters alone,&#8221; <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-04-09/automattic-steward-of-wordpress-snaps-up-longreads">Mullenweg told Bloomberg Businessweek</a>. &#8220;Longreads embodies a lot of what we really value with Automattic and WordPress.&#8221; WordPress software &#8212; either the open-source or the paid-for version &#8212; is the publishing engine behind millions of websites and some major media entities, including Gigaom, and WordPress.com has also been <a href="http://paidcontent.org/2013/03/09/where-wordpress-is-headed-longform-content-curation-and-maybe-some-native-advertising/">trying to become more of a portal</a> that points readers towards good content.</p>
<p>Automattic vice-president Raanan Bar-Cohen <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/longreads-joins-automattic/">said in a post</a> on the WordPress blog that the two companies made for a good fit because &#8220;we are entering a new era for independent writers and publishers to embrace depth and quality, and WordPress.com is committed to empowering these creators.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class='twitter-tweet'><p>So excited for what&#8217;s next with @<a href="https://twitter.com/Longreads">Longreads</a> and @<a href="https://twitter.com/wordpressdotcom">wordpressdotcom</a>. Thank you to everyone who has participated in the <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23longreads" title="#longreads">#longreads</a> community&mdash; <br />Mark Armstrong (@markarms) <a href='http://twitter.com/#!/markarms/status/454001883867144192' data-datetime='2014-04-09T21:04:18+00:00'>April 09, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Mark Armstrong, founder of Longreads and a former journalist, said that the service would continue as it had before the acquisition, and that joining WordPress would allow the community to grow and expand. <a href="http://longreads.com">The site currently offers</a> a free weekly email or a $3 membership that provides daily recommendations. In an email, Armstrong said that there&#8217;s a lot more that he wants to provide, and partnering with WordPress would allow him to do so:</p>
<blockquote id="quote-the-longreads-commun"><p>&#8220;The Longreads community, and the appetite for great storytelling, has grown so much since I first started the service five years ago. That said, I knew there was more that we could be doing to both serve readers and keep building a thriving ecosystem for independent publishers and writers. I first met Matt Mullenweg four years ago, and I have always been a huge fan of the mission and principles of Automattic and WordPress. It seemed like a perfect fit for Longreads to join up and explore new opportunities for readers, writers and publishers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

      <description><![CDATA[Comcast is compounding its extensive Wi-Fi network with even more Wi-Fi. But these new hotspots aren't  coffee shop and outdoor access points. They're inside its broadband customers' homes.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833252&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comcast revealed on Wednesday it has grown its Wi-Fi hotspot network to 1 million nodes. Considering that on Tuesday its FCC filing on its planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/04/08/seeking-an-edge-with-regulators-comcast-dangles-the-idea-of-a-wi-fi-first-mobile-network/">listed 870,000 hotspots</a>, it appears to be ramping up its wireless network quickly.</p>
<p>Comcast can scale so quickly because its broadband <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/06/10/comcast-mimics-fon-creating-a-crowdsourced-hotspot-network-in-millions-of-homes/">customers are doing much of the heavy lifting</a>. Its latest wireless home gateways all operate in dual modes, providing a private home network for the customer and a public network that can be accessed by any Comcast broadband customer. Comcast also offers public hotspot capabilities to all of its business customers and has built with thousands of high-powered outdoor hotspots in key high-traffic zones in its operating territory.</p>
<div id="attachment_832955" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 708px"><a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/04/08/seeking-an-edge-with-regulators-comcast-dangles-the-idea-of-a-wi-fi-first-mobile-network/screen-shot-2014-04-08-at-2-30-47-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-832955"><img  src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-08-at-2-30-47-pm.png?w=708&#038;h=465" alt="Comcast's hotspot network in the mid-Atlantic (source: Comcast)" width="708" height="465" class="size-large wp-image-832955" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Comcast&#8217;s hotspot network in the mid-Atlantic (source: Comcast)</p></div>
<p>Comcast isn’t breaking out how many neighborhood hotspots it’s running versus commercial access points, but they make up the vast majority of its network. Comcast is part of the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/06/10/who-has-the-largest-wi-fi-network-in-the-us-cable-companies-say-they-do/">CableWiFi consortium</a>, which pools together the outdoor and business hotspots of Time Warner, Cox Communications, Cablevision Systems and Bright House Networks. CableWiFi has <a href="https://www.ncta.com/platform/public-policy/did-we-say-150000-because-cable-has-just-hit-200000-wi-fi-hotspots/">200,000 hotspots in total</a>, meaning Comcast has more than 800,000 access points transmitting from living room shelves.</p>
<p>Though its hotspot network is a <a href="http://www.comcast.com/wifi/default.htm?SCRedirect=true&amp;CMP=KNC-IQ_ID_60359152-VQ2-g-VQ3--VQ6-39645821969-VQ16-c-pkw-%2Bxfinity%20%2Bwifi-pmt-b&amp;iq_id=60359152">considerable resource for Comcast’s customers</a>, it’s not the easiest to use. Customers still have to log in to each hotspot using their Xfinity credentials, but emerging technologies like Hotspot 2.0 will eventually make those connections automatic.

      <description><![CDATA[A startup called Emerald Logic claims it uses an evolutionary process to discover the best algorithm for predicting outcomes from any dataset. It might sound to good to be true, but the company claims successes already and is one of several startups trying something similar.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833125&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Think about being a hospital that wants to improve survival rates for patients. You have lots of data about patients &#8212; their medical histories, EKG readings, room numbers, doctors, billing information and much more &#8212; and you certainly know whether they leave alive or dead. Somewhere in all that data, the current thinking goes, there must be a formula that can predict what&#8217;s going to happen.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not so much a <em>big</em> data problem as much as it&#8217;s a <em>complex </em>data problem. According to Patrick Lilley, co-founder and CEO of an Aliso Viejo, Calif., startup called <a href="http://www.emeraldlogic.com/">Emerald Logic</a>, the real world runs on systems where there are inputs and outcomes, only the complexity of the data we&#8217;re generating makes it very difficult to find the inputs that will lead to the best outcomes. He equates it to sticking a marble in a black box, eventually getting it out the other side, and then having to diagram what you think the inside looks like.</p>
<p>&#8220;The challenge there is you have to model what&#8217;s going in that system and you can&#8217;t often look inside,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lilley also claims his company can help you find the answer. The company&#8217;s software, called FACET (short for <span style="color:#555555;">Fast Collective Evolution Technology)</span>, tests tens of thousands of algorithms against a dataset in order to find ones that represent the relationships between those data and the end result. He calls the process &#8220;evolutionary computing,&#8221; because they evolve, mate and migrate, and only the best one survives.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a monkeys-on-typewriters sort of problem,&#8221; he acknowledged, referencing those theories about how long it would take a group of primates to reproduce the complete works of Shakespeare. The software doesn&#8217;t know anything about the field it&#8217;s working on or have any presuppositions about what&#8217;s in it. It&#8217;s simply trying to predict one thing from another, and he says it&#8217;s pretty effective.</p>
<p>FACET works by taking a sample of a dataset, generating tens of thousands of algorithms from it, and then testing them in order to determine the most-predictive one. &#8220;Because it&#8217;s evolution, it tends to wash away the variables and the math operators that are unimportant,&#8221; Lilley explained. &#8220;&#8230; No more than eight things have ever mattered in any model we&#8217;ve ever generated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the process is complete, the algorithm is tested against new data in order to ensure its predictions are still accurate. Emerald Logic delivers FACET as a cloud service, so customers really only pay for the algorithm it produces. Customers own all the intellectual property associated with it, and Emerald Logic charges based on the economic value of the problem it&#8217;s trying to solve.</p>
<h2 id="a-hot-field-for-startups-actua">A hot field for startups, actually</h2>
<p>All of this probably sounds a little too good to be true &#8212; and maybe it is &#8212; but Emerald Logic is really just putting a different spin on something that multiple startups are also pushing. There is BeyondCore, with <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/02/18/beyondcore-raises-9m-to-automate-data-analysis/">its service for finding the variables most statistically relevant</a> to a given outcome, and <a href="http://emcien.com/">Emcien</a>. There&#8217;s Ayasdi, which runs thousands of machine learning algorithms <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/16/has-ayasdi-turned-machine-learning-into-a-magic-bullet/">to discover and then visualize connections among massive datasets</a>.</p>
<p>Emerald Logic&#8217;s promise actually sounds similar to that of Nutonian, a startup from former Cornell Creative Machine Labs researcher Michael Schmidt that claims its Eureqa software <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/10/23/nutonian-raises-4m-to-extract-laws-of-physics-from-your-data/">can &#8220;</a><span style="color:#2a2e33;"><a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/10/23/nutonian-raises-4m-to-extract-laws-of-physics-from-your-data/">calculate laws of physics&#8221; present in business data</a>.</span></p>
<p>Each approach runs into the question of whether anyone can trust some software to uncover what&#8217;s important in their data, but that&#8217;s not exactly the case. Once data scientists or business analysts see what the software has come up with, they can dive in and look at the variables, examine the connections, and figure out if they buy into it. They can run tests to determine if maybe there&#8217;s something there worth investigating further.</p>
<h2 id="artificial-imagination">&#8220;Artificial imagination&#8221;</h2>
<p class="p1">Besides, Lilley argued, he has proof that FACET works. The company did work with King&#8217;s College in London around identifying markers for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and highlighted 14 out of a list of 11,000 possibilities. Half of them had already been mentioned on prior literature, a quarter had been thought of as possible markers and the remaining quarter were novel to FACET. It would have been easy to ignore what what the software found had it not validated those previous findings and inklings, Lilley said.</p>
<p class="p1">According to <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emerald-logic-announces-collaboration-with-kings-college-london-on-quantitative-biomarker-discovery-189970381.html">a February 2013 press release announcing that partnership</a>, &#8220;Using these markers, plus APOE genetic information and demographics, the collaborators produced a mathematical classifier of 94% accuracy in distinguishing Alzheimer&#8217;s study subjects from controls or with those with mild cognitive impairment.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">In finance, FACET routinely finds that how a company incorporates is a strong predictor of whether it will succeed. In consumer loans, it has found that &#8220;effectively, liars tell longer stories,&#8221; Lilley said.</p>
<p class="p1">And in fact, he noted, Emerald Logic is his third startup with the same co-founder and FACET is kind of just an iteration on the technologies of the previous two. The first, called Digital Transit, used a genetic algorithm to do over-the-air software updates for mobile phones. That company merged with Bitfone in 2001, which HP acquired in 2006. In January 2014, Qualcomm bought the associated patents from HP.</p>
<p class="p1">The second startup, called Deep Six Technologies, generated decision trees based on data about email servers in order to do spam detection. The two founders have been working on Emerald Logic since 2011.</p>
<p>Whether or not FACET &#8212; or anything of its ilk &#8212; turns out to be a magic bullet, they&#8217;re all working under the same assumption that has driven the push of big data technologies and data science into the mainstream. Namely, that if data really does contain answers to tricky problems, there&#8217;s no way a person can figure out all the right questions to ask to find those answers among thousands of different variables. At some point, some parts of the process must be automated in order to steer people in the right direction.</p>
<p>This is why Lilley refers to Emerald Logic and FACET as &#8220;artificial imagination&#8221; rather than &#8220;artificial intelligence. &#8220;The more expertise someone has in a field,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;the more they know better and the less they sort of look around.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;&#8230; This method is pretty sideways. It&#8217;s not the way people are used to thinking about the problem.&#8221;</p>

      <description><![CDATA[A clash between Apple's human interface VP Greg Christie and design chief Jony Ive has come to head and is leading to Christie's departure from the company, 9to5Mac reports.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833231&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#8217;s vaunted design group appears to be going through some changes. According to <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/04/09/jony-ive-shakes-up-apples-software-design-group-iphone-interface-creator-greg-christie-departing/">a report from 9to5Mac</a>, friction between head of software design Greg Christie and design SVP Jony Ive (pictured) has resulted in a shakeup that led to Ive taking control over all design activity related to software and hardware and will likely see Christie leave the company.</p>
<p>Citing unnamed sources, 9to5Mac stated the two began clashing after Ive took over human interface design responsibilities in 2012 in a move that also saw <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/10/29/from-inside-apple-the-scott-forstall-fallout/">the departure of former Apple software leader Scott Forstall</a>. When Ive’s team took on the redesign of the iPhone’s interface to create iOS 7’s new look he came into conflict with Christie, who wanted to go in a different design direction, the report said. That clash led to Ive wresting to control of the project during the new OS’s development, according to 9to5Mac.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/04/apple-confirms-departure-of-prominent-designer-greg-christie/">An Apple spokesperson confirmed</a> to the <em>Financial Times</em> (registration required) that Christie is leaving the company, though it played down any suggestion of conflict between Christie and Ives. The statement Apple gave to FT said: &#8220;Greg has been planning to retire later this year after nearly 20 years at Apple. He has made vital contributions to Apple products across the board, and built a world-class Human Interface team which has worked closely with Jony for many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now everything design-related at Apple will fall under Ive, who is a legend within the design community for his role in developing the products that have Apple still raking in boatloads of cash. But Christie was a key contributor. According to a recent (and rare) interview <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303949704579461783150723874">granted to The Wall Street Journal</a>, Christie &#8212; who first came to Apple in 1996 to work on the Newton, the report said &#8212; was deeply involved with the creation of iOS and the iPhone.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[What happens if you install secret tracking software on the phones of tens of millions of people and sell their location to advertisers? Not much, if a new FTC order is anything to go by.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833203&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even judging by the low standards of creepy data-mining apps, &#8220;Brightest Flashlight&#8221; did something pretty egregious. The free app, which was installed by at least 50 million Android users, transmitted users&#8217; real-time locations to ad networks and other third parties. It was, in other words, a stalking device disguised as a flashlight.</p>
<p>In December, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/131205goldenshorescmpt.pdf?Source=govdelivery">exposed </a>the app&#8217;s antics and also announced a proposed settlement with the app maker, GoldenShores Technologies, a one-man operation based in Idaho. In doing so, the agency explained how Brightest Flashlight used legal flim-flam in a privacy policy and user license agreement to obscure what the app was up to.</p>
<p>The terms are now final, and they&#8217;re underwhelming, to put it mildly.</p>
<p>In a Wednesday announcement, the FTC confirmed that GoldenShores and owner Erik Geidl are not to collect app users&#8217; geolocation without clearly explaining how and why they&#8217;re doing so and, in broad terms, say who is receiving that information. The flashlight app maker will also have to keep records for the FTC to inspect, and Geidl will have to tell the agency about any new businesses he decides to start in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>On paper, <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140409goldenshoresdo.pdf?Source=govdelivery">the order</a> looks like stern stuff but, in practice, it&#8217;s hard to see how this amounts to real punishment. Even though Geidl did something deeply unethical, compromising the privacy of tens of millions of people, he will not pay a cent for his misdeeds.</p>
<p>The FTC said earlier that it didn&#8217;t seek financial restitution because the app was free. The agency&#8217;s justification is unsatisfying, however, because it doesn&#8217;t acknowledge that Geidl must have earned earned income by selling users&#8217; geolocation. A better approach would have been to strip him of any profits he made through the app, and also name-and-shame the advertisers who bought the information from him.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s good that the FTC is helping to publicize the mischief of app makers, it&#8217;s unlikely that bad actors will take the agency seriously until it starts setting down real punishments on people like Geidl and the ecosystem that sustain them.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833203&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><p><a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/1008864/Gigaom_RSS_300x250&#038;sz=300x250&#038;c=796476"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/1008864/Gigaom_RSS_300x250&#038;sz=300x250&#038;c=796476" /></a></p><p><strong>Related research and analysis from Gigaom Research:</strong><br />Subscriber content. <a href="http://research.gigaom.com/?utm_source=tech&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=833203+brightest-flashlight-android-app-disclosed-location-of-50-million-people-but-ftc-imposes-no-fine&utm_content=jeffjohnroberts">Sign up for a free trial</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/consumer-privacy-in-the-mobile-advertising-era-challenges-and-best-practices/?utm_source=tech&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=833203+brightest-flashlight-android-app-disclosed-location-of-50-million-people-but-ftc-imposes-no-fine&utm_content=jeffjohnroberts">Consumer privacy in the mobile advertising era: challenges and best practices</a></li><li><a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/connected-world-the-consumer-technology-revolution/?utm_source=tech&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=833203+brightest-flashlight-android-app-disclosed-location-of-50-million-people-but-ftc-imposes-no-fine&utm_content=jeffjohnroberts">Connected world: the consumer technology revolution</a></li><li><a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/sector-roadmap-content-personalization-in-2013/?utm_source=tech&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=833203+brightest-flashlight-android-app-disclosed-location-of-50-million-people-but-ftc-imposes-no-fine&utm_content=jeffjohnroberts">Sector RoadMap: Content personalization in 2013</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[The Wi-Fi Alliance is certifying a new technology that uses an NFC tap to grant devices access to Wi-Fi networks. The technology is targeted at the internet of things, but it would be very useful for smartphones too.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833219&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Wi-Fi starts making its way into more internet-of-things gadgets, connecting those devices to Wi-Fi networks is becoming a chore. These activity trackers, thermostats and cameras don’t necessarily have the user interfaces or even screens we would use to configure a Wi-Fi connection on our smartphones or PCs. The Wi-Fi Alliance is now trying to make those connections easier with the help of near-field communications (NFC).</p>
<p>The Alliance has <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-certified-wi-fi-protected-setup%E2%84%A2-adds-nfc-tap-to-connect-for-simple-set">updated its Wi-Fi Protected Setup certification program</a> to support NFC verification. Instead of entering a password or holding down buttons, you simply tap two Wi-Fi devices with NFC chips together to establish a connection. The technology can be used to connect devices to a local network by tapping a router, or two end-user devices by tapping them together.</p>
<p>For example, I’ve been <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/11/12/whistle-review-dog-activity-tracker/">testing out Whistle’s dog activity tracker</a> for the last few months, which uses both Bluetooth to connect to my phone and Wi-Fi to connect to home network. Connecting my Whistle to my home network is a multi-step task, requiring first pairing the gadget with my phone with Bluetooth and then configuring the device to connect to my Wi-Fi through Whistle’s smartphone network. Whistle is more useful the more networks it connects to, but if I wanted to add additional Wi-Fi networks to the device – say at my parents’ place or at the kennel &#8212; the owners of those networks would have to go through the same process.</p>
<div id="attachment_654531" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 708px"><a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/06/05/quantifying-your-pup-whistle-wants-to-create-the-worlds-largest-database-on-dog-behavior/screen-shot-2013-06-05-at-9-29-24-am/" rel="attachment wp-att-654531"><img  src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/screen-shot-2013-06-05-at-9-29-24-am.png?w=708&#038;h=439" alt="The Whistle canine activity tracker (source: Whistle)" width="708" height="439" class="size-large wp-image-654531" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Whistle canine activity tracker (source: Whistle)</p></div>
<p>The new Wi-Fi Protected capability (and an NFC chip) would make Whistle connect instantly to the network over a secure WPA2 connection with a mere bump against the router. Of course, that’s assuming you want to give that kind of easy access to the world of internet-of-things devices. Wi-Fi Protected uses proximity as security, assuming if you can get close to a router or gadget, then it&#8217;s authorized to share connectivity. Not everyone wants their Wi-Fi networks &#8212; or devices &#8212; to be so open.</p>
<p>A small startup called <a href="http://www.pylonproducts.com/">Pylon is exploring some interesting use cases for NFC-brokered connections</a> in the home that may address some of those security concerns. It has developed a Wi-Fi beacon that creates a guest wireless network that can be accessed with an NFC tap or a “bump” of the iPhone (the accelerometers in the devices trigger the handshake). Instead of granting all network rights to those guest devices, Pylon could restrict users to internet access only and for a short interval, say 30 minutes.</p>
<p><img  src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/screen-shot-2014-04-09-at-2-17-49-pm.png?w=708" alt="Pylon's NFC-brokered Wi-Fi system (source: Pylon)"   class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833222" /></p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Alliance said it is now certifying devices using the new technology, and among the gadgets on its test list is <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/10/">Google’s Nexus 10 tablet</a>. I wouldn’t, however, expect a huge flood of new gadgets using the capabilities. While NFC is making it into more and more smartphones, it’s still rare in devices like wearable and smart appliances. The goal of many these device manufacturers is to make their devices as inexpensive as possible, and adding an additional radio contradicts that trend.</p>
<p>Still, there could be a lot of use cases for NFC-brokered connections in smartphones. Instead of trying to dig up passwords whenever a friend wants to connect to your home network, they could just tap to connect. And as <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/02/12/hands-on-with-gms-new-4g-powered-connected-car-system/">Wi-Fi hotspots make their way into connected cars</a>, Wi-Fi Protected could be a brilliantly simple way to connect a tablet to the in-car network.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[Mailbox, the iOS email app that Dropbox acquired last year, is rolling out Android and desktop versions.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833194&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mailbox, the iOS email app that Dropbox <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/03/15/dropbox-buys-red-hot-mobile-email-startup-mailbox/">acquired last March</a>, is expanding to two new platforms &#8212; Android and Mac OS X.</p>
<p class="p1">Mailbox for Android, available as of Wednesday, is an equivalent experience to its iOS cousin, but adds a new feature called &#8220;Auto-swipe.&#8221; When a user takes action on a particular email, like archiving a daily deals wrap-up, Mailbox will remember it and ask to automate that action for the future. Acting as a new filter, all Auto-swipe preferences will be synced across devices.</p>
<p>Starting today, Mailbox uses Dropbox to sync preferences and Auto-swipe patterns across email accounts and devices,&#8221; the company<a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/blog/" target="_blank"> said in a blog post</a>. &#8220;That means you get a seamless experience no matter which device or email account you use.&#8221;</p>
<p>The feature will be available in an update to the iOS app.</p>
<p>But Mailbox for Desktop, released in limited beta for OS X only, is the more exciting product. The minimalistic interface remains true to the app&#8217;s mobile roots, and it ports many of the common gestures on Mailbox directly to a trackpad. This means that the app remains consistent across all platforms to keep user confusion low. As of now, no release date is set for the product.</p>

<p>Mailbox for Android and Mac was one of many announcements made at a Dropbox special event on Wednesday in San Francisco. The company also <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/04/09/dropbox-ok-now-were-really-serious-about-the-enterprise/">announced a new business platform</a>, as well as <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/04/09/dropbox-announces-photo-sharing-app-carousel/">photo-sharing app Carousel</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[In its quest to make Dropbox more enterprise-worthy, the company rebuilt the entire application, adding remote wipe, audit tracking, and content reassignment to the mix.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=832862&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dropbox has rewritten its popular namesake file-share application to be more enterprise friendly. The goal here to reassure businesses that Dropbox for Business is indeed to be trusted with corporate content and, oh by the way, get more companies to buy it as a result.</p>
<p>&#8220;We rebuilt all of Dropbox to give everyone two Dropboxes; one personal with your password your contacts, and a second company Dropbox accessible to you but managed by company. But you don&#8217;t want it to be klugey and hard to go back and forth. Most of us have one phone so we had to reengineer our interfaces,&#8221; said Ilya Fushman, director of product, mobile and business for the San Francisco-based company, ahead of an event in the city designed to highlight the new features.</p>
<p>Before, if Jane Doe had her personal Dropbox on her device and wanted to sign into the old <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/06/27/news-flash-dropbox-still-wants-to-be-the-dropbox-of-the-enterprise/">Dropbox for Business</a>, she really couldn&#8217;t do so without some sort of hack. The revamped Dropbox solves that problem by letting Doe, the individual, have that personal account and Doe, the employee, have an IT-managed business account accessible from the same device.</p>
<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/04/09/dropbox-ok-now-were-really-serious-about-the-enterprise/dropbox-for-business-wipe/" rel="attachment wp-att-832963"><img  src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dropbox-for-business-wipe.jpg?w=708&#038;h=481" alt="dropbox for business wipe" width="708" height="481" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-832963" /></a>And now, if Doe loses her device, corporate data can be wiped clean remotely. If she quits, IT can reassign business content to another authorized user &#8212; a key demand for Dropbox for Business up till now. Oh, and the new business version also gives IT a view into who opened what documents when. Such auditing is crucial to many companies.</p>
<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/04/09/dropbox-ok-now-were-really-serious-about-the-enterprise/dropbox-for-business-dual-account/" rel="attachment wp-att-832964"><img  src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dropbox-for-business-dual-account.jpg?w=708&#038;h=503" alt="dropbox for business dual account" width="708" height="503" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-832964" /></a>With the old setup, the difficulty of accessing both personal and work Dropbox from one device meant users often synched work documents with their personal accounts. That sets up the sort of data leakage scenario that give IT fits. In theory, the easy coexistence of accounts from one device will alleviate that problem. In addition, segregating content on the business accounts means that third-party vendors &#8212; like NCrypted Cloud and BoxCryptor &#8212; can focus on layering additional security on that data.</p>
<p>If much of this sounds familiar it&#8217;s because these administrative capabilities are what Box and other <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/03/19/who-will-be-the-dropbox-of-the-enterprise-the-race-is-on/">would-be Dropbox-for-the-enterprise companies</a> already offer. Box, for example, has offered remote wipe via partnerships with <span style="color:#000000;">Good Technology and </span><span style="color:#000000;">MobileIron for some time.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span>What those vendors may not have is Dropbox&#8217;s gigantic name recognition among consumers. That brand already made the older Dropbox for Business an easy sell into small businesses, said Jim Turner, president of <a href="http://www.hilltopconsultants.com/">Hilltop Consultants, </a>a managed service provider. End users want Dropbox and their bosses sign off on it because it&#8217;s a well-known name backed by a trusted partner, he said.</p>
<p>At a special event Wednesday in San Francisco, the company also announced a collaboration tool called &#8220;Project Harmony,&#8221; designed to help remedy when two users are working on the same file. Deployed within native apps, starting with Microsoft Office for both Mac and PC, Dropbox pops up a small notification window that tells the user how many people and who are actually working on the file at the same time. The feature also includes a chat system, and live refresh so users can quickly update documents.</p>
<p>Dropbox now claims 275 million (!) users, and that it is used in 97 percent of Fortune 500 accounts, but still does not break out paying customers. The company really needs to make it easier for people who bring Dropbox in from home to upgrade to a paid business account without sacrificing ease of use. This is just another step in that road.</p>
<p>Dropbox for all its resources, still may have a tough row to hoe in business accounts where Microsoft and Google are making big plays OneDrive and Google Drive respectively.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=832862&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><p><a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/1008864/Gigaom_RSS_300x250&#038;sz=300x250&#038;c=770401"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/1008864/Gigaom_RSS_300x250&#038;sz=300x250&#038;c=770401" /></a></p><p><strong>Related research and analysis from Gigaom Research:</strong><br />Subscriber content. <a href="http://research.gigaom.com/?utm_source=cloud&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=832862+dropbox-ok-now-were-really-serious-about-the-enterprise&utm_content=gigabarb">Sign up for a free trial</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/how-scribbling-on-an-ipad-makes-your-work-life-easier/?utm_source=cloud&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=832862+dropbox-ok-now-were-really-serious-about-the-enterprise&utm_content=gigabarb">How scribbling on an iPad makes your work life easier</a></li><li><a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/social-third-quarter-2013-analysis-and-outlook/?utm_source=cloud&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=832862+dropbox-ok-now-were-really-serious-about-the-enterprise&utm_content=gigabarb">A look back at the third quarter of 2013</a></li><li><a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/cloud-and-data-first-quarter-2013-analysis-and-outlook/?utm_source=cloud&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=832862+dropbox-ok-now-were-really-serious-about-the-enterprise&utm_content=gigabarb">Cloud and data first-quarter 2013: analysis and outlook</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[At a special event Wednesday, Dropbox announced a new cloud-based photo sharing app, Carousel.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833152&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday Dropbox announced a batch of new consumer products for both mobile and desktop consumers. But Drew Houston, co-founder and CEO, saved the best for last: a photo-sharing feature that allows users to sync seamlessly through Dropbox called <a href="http://www.carousel.com">Carousel</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;m looking at the photos on my phone, I see photos I took with the phone, but I don&#8217;t see pictures from my computer or anything else,&#8221; said Drew Houston, co-founder and CEO speaking at a special event in San Francisco. &#8220;Instead of one shoebox, I have many shoeboxes.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_833181" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 708px"><a href="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/photo2.jpg"><img  src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/photo2.jpg?w=708&#038;h=531" alt="Drew Houston debuts Dropbox's new Carousel feature. Photo by Lauren Hockenson/Gigaom" width="708" height="531" class="size-large wp-image-833181" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Drew Houston debuts Dropbox&#8217;s new photo sharing app Carousel. Photo by Lauren Hockenson/Gigaom</p></div><br />
Carousel is a standalone app, powered by Dropbox, that aims to solve that problem. Houston said the company has been working on it for years. It works kind of like a Facebook Timeline, organizing photos into events and surfacing important photos to highlight each event. The app doesn&#8217;t actually locally store any photos or videos on a phone &#8212; everything is in the cloud, but accessible at all times. Carousel also has auto-backup, syncing photos across platforms. The app is available free, but those who want more than 5GB of space will have to pay to upgrade their account.<a href="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/carousel_ios_event_share.png"><img src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/carousel_ios_event_share.png?w=168&#038;h=300" alt="Carousel_iOS_Event_Share"    class="alignright size-medium wp-image-833216" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Everywhere you are, you have every picture you&#8217;ve ever taken organized in a beautiful timeline,&#8221; Houston explained. &#8220;But not only that, you have every picture that&#8217;s been taken of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Photos can also be shared between users in an interface reminiscent of a chat window: They can tap and quickly share batches of photos, comment on them with a message, and share with both individuals and a group. Photos and video sent can sync directly to the user&#8217;s Timeline with a click.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after the company <a href="http://recode.net/2014/04/06/dropbox-secures-more-than-500m-in-credit/" target="_blank">reportedly took out $500 million in debt financing</a> on top of the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/02/24/officially-dropbox-has-raised-325-million/">$350 million funding round</a> it raised in February. Dropbox now has more than 275 million users &#8212; a 75 million user increase from last year.</p>
<p>Carousel is available today for iOS and Android.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gigaom.com&#038;blog=14960843&#038;post=833152&#038;subd=gigaom2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><p><a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/1008864/Gigaom_RSS_300x250&#038;sz=300x250&#038;c=513811"><img src="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/1008864/Gigaom_RSS_300x250&#038;sz=300x250&#038;c=513811" /></a></p><p><strong>Related research and analysis from Gigaom Research:</strong><br />Subscriber content. <a href="http://research.gigaom.com/?utm_source=tech&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=833152+dropbox-announces-photo-sharing-app-carousel&utm_content=laurenhockenson">Sign up for a free trial</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/11-steps-for-scaling-a-startup/?utm_source=tech&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=833152+dropbox-announces-photo-sharing-app-carousel&utm_content=laurenhockenson">6 steps for scaling a startup</a></li><li><a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/practical-business-content-collaboration-personal-tools-show-the-way/?utm_source=tech&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=833152+dropbox-announces-photo-sharing-app-carousel&utm_content=laurenhockenson">Practical business content collaboration: Personal tools show the way</a></li><li><a href="http://research.gigaom.com/report/applying-lean-startup-theory-in-large-enterprises/?utm_source=tech&utm_medium=editorial&utm_campaign=auto3&utm_term=833152+dropbox-announces-photo-sharing-app-carousel&utm_content=laurenhockenson">Applying lean startup theory in large enterprises</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

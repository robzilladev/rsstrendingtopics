GUI based, event driven RSS Feed analyser.
This application can load RSS feeds from a file, or from a URL, and display them appropriately within the GUI.
Further, this application can analyse the RSS items and identify 'trending topics', by counting reoccuring words within an item and comparing them to those of the other items.
Items can be sorted by various sorting criteria, and randomised (if that's your thing..).
Enjoy..

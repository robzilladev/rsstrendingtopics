The looming threat of running an unsupported OS wasn’t enough to save PC shipments from continuing their slide in the first quarter.</p><p>
Worldwide PC shipments fell by 4.4 percent in the first three months of the year to 73.4 million units, IDC <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24794514">said</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>
The expiration of Windows XP, support for which ended this week, did prompt some businesses to refresh their PCs. And slower demand for tablets, as the market becomes saturated, may have helped lift laptop sales slightly.</p><p>
But sales were down overall, and the trend toward more mobile devices is unlikely to stop, IDC said.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2142080/windows-xp-expiration-couldnt-save-pc-market-in-q1.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

Apple began to lay out its $2.2 billion damages claim against Samsung Electronics for the first time on Tuesday, arguing to an eight-person jury in California that Samsung’s alleged patent infringement was large and significantly damaged Apple.</p><p>
Apple is demanding the money for lost sales and royalties it says it suffered as a result of Samsung’s sale of more than 37 million smartphones and tablets between August 2011 and the end of 2013, the company told the court.</p><p>
The trial, which began last week, involves five Apple patents and 10 Samsung products: nine models of smartphones and one tablet.</p><p>
The patents are the “slide-to-unlock” function that takes the phone from the lock screen to home screen; universal search, which pulls in results from the phone and the Internet; the ability to sync data in the background; automatic word correction as a user types; and contextual links that attach a menu to items such as phone numbers, email addresses and postal addresses.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2141520/apple-details-22b-damages-claim-against-samsung.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

The companies built a proof-of-concept supercomputer that’s kept cool using a fluid developed by 3M called Novec. It’s a dielectric liquid, which means electronics can be submerged in it and continue to operate normally.</p><p>

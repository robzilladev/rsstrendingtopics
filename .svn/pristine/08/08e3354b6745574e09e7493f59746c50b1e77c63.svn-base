      <title>Dropbox bringing Mailbox email client to the Mac</title>

<p>
Amid a slew of announcements today, Dropbox dropped one that’ll be of particular interest to Mac users: Mailbox, the <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2027388/review-mailbox-for-iphone-belongs-in-your-dock.html">acclaimed email client for iOS</a>, is coming to the Mac. Mailbox for OS X is in public beta now; you can sign up at the <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/">Mailbox website</a>.</p><p>
The public beta isn’t surprising: It’s reminiscent of the way the developer originally rolled out the iOS version in early 2013. Then, you'd download the app, but you had to get on <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2025904/reservations-open-for-upcoming-mailbox-for-iphone-app.html">a waiting list</a> to actually use it. (That <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2034736/now-you-can-usemailbox-app-with-no-reservations.html">waiting list went away</a> a couple of months later.)</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2141822/dropbox-bringing-mailbox-email-client-to-the-mac.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

      <title>How to make exported iPhoto image titles "sticky"</title>

<p>
Reader Ed Dorroh, like many people, is perplexed by what goes on when moving images out of iPhoto. He writes:</p><blockquote>
<em>When I add a title to a photo in iPhoto and then drag that photo to the desktop, the file name reverts back to its original name—“IMG_0697.jpg” for example. Is there any way to title a photo in iPhoto and make it “stick” when I export it?</em>
</blockquote>


<p>
There is, and you’ve unwittingly uttered the key word—<em>export</em>. As you’ve observed, when you drag a file from iPhoto to the desktop it retains its original file name. In the case of images that were originally in the JPEG or PNG formats, it also retains those formats. Raw images are converted to JPEG images. Any metadata you’ve attached to an image—title and description, for example—are lost.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2140904/how-to-make-exported-iphoto-image-titles-sticky.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

In a recent story about <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2089882/">simplifying your email system</a>, I mentioned nine plug-ins for Apple Mail that I use to transform it from a fair email client into a much more powerful tool. A number of people have asked me what those plug-ins are, so here’s my list.

Network security is a topic that makes many people’s eyes glaze over, and I can’t blame them.

<p>
Apple began to lay out its $2.2 billion damages claim against Samsung Electronics for the first time on Tuesday, arguing to an eight-person jury in California that Samsung’s alleged patent infringement was large and significantly damaged Apple.</p><p>
Apple is demanding the money for lost sales and royalties it says it suffered as a result of Samsung’s sale of more than 37 million smartphones and tablets between August 2011 and the end of 2013, the company told the court.</p><p>
The trial, which began last week, involves five Apple patents and 10 Samsung products: nine models of smartphones and one tablet.</p><p>
The patents are the “slide-to-unlock” function that takes the phone from the lock screen to home screen; universal search, which pulls in results from the phone and the Internet; the ability to sync data in the background; automatic word correction as a user types; and contextual links that attach a menu to items such as phone numbers, email addresses and postal addresses.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2141520/apple-details-22b-damages-claim-against-samsung.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

And it’s a pretty Mac-centric group, too; According to the team, “everyone has an iPad, and the Mac:PC ratio is 16:1.” Don’t expect them to reveal when the next version of Office might make its way to the Mac, however; when asked, the group would only say “we are working on the next version.”</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2141101/five-interesting-tidbits-from-the-office-for-ipad-ama.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

Thanks to the Apple-Samsung trial, we the users have been learning all sorts of interesting closed door facts about Apple’s higher-ups and advertising partners. A smattering of these fine facts: Steve Jobs and his associates discussed <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/internal-apple-presentation-on-iphone-business-2014-4">market share and larger iPhone sizes</a> behind closed doors. The folks at Media Arts Lab, Apple’s design agency, don’t seem to like capital letters very much. And if you write to Apple’s SVP of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, you probably shouldn’t compare the Apple of today with Apple in 1997. Or he gets angry. You wouldn’t like him when he’s angry.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2141084/you-wouldnt-like-phil-schiller-when-hes-angry.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

      <title>Canon Pixma iP8720 review: Photo printer produces sharp super-sized pics</title>

The <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/printers_multifunction/photo_inkjet_printers/pixma_ip8720">Canon Pixma iP8720</a> is a color inkjet printer aimed at advanced amateur photographers looking to supersize their prints. The iP8720 uses six inks to produce borderless prints as large as 13 by 19 inches and is a great fit for owners of Canon’s Rebel line of digital SLR cameras.</p><p>
Along with the standard cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks, the iP8720 offers photo black and photo gray inks as well. The printer ships with “setup” cartridges, but is compatible with standard cartridges ($75 a set) and high-capacity cartridges ($113 a set). Canon provides estimated print yield data for their cartridges, but the info is buried deep in the company’s website. Doing the math, printing a 4-by-6 color photo on photo paper will cost you about 24 cents in ink using the XL cartridges and 37 cents when using the standard capacity cartridges.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2139931/canon-pixma-ip8720-review-large-format-photo-printer-produces-pleasing-pics.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

Even before <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1164889/ibooks_author_offers_free_e_textbook_creation.html">iBooks Author took the stage in 2012</a>, Apple offered the average Mac user a way to build basic ebooks through its word-processing software, Pages. Now, after four years of stagnation, the company has (surprisingly) started improving the app’s ePub export capabilities. Here’s a look at what’s changed (and what still needs work).</p><h2>Four years of silence</h2>
<p>
Pages originally debuted its ebook export option back <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1153697/iwork_904.html">in August of 2010</a>. Like its Word export feature, Pages’s ebook export could only translate certain aspects of your document into ePub format (the primary filetype used by iBooks as well as most non-Amazon readers available at the time); so, for example, certain text stylings and rich text elements might not appear correctly in the ePub. Additionally, many of those elements required very precise formatting in the Pages document in order to actually appear in the exported file. </p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2140800/making-ebooks-in-pages-5-2-heres-what-works-now-and-what-still-doesnt.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

<p>
The eight-person jury hearing Apple’s patent infringement case against Samsung was thrown into the deep end Monday and subjected to some heady talk of subroutines and class libraries.</p><p>
It was a big contrast to last week, when the court got a behind-the-scenes look at the birth of the iPhone and were told of <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2139020/steve-jobs-called-for-holy-war-against-google.html">a Steve Jobs email</a> in which the former Apple boss called for a “holy war” against Google.</p><p>
But the technical discussion Monday was inevitable in a patent case and could do much to determine the outcome of the trial. It’s not enough to prove a defendant built similar features in its phones—Apple’s lawyers have to show a feature was accomplished in precisely the manner described in one of its patents.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2140880/applesamsung-jury-discovers-joys-of-subroutines-class-libraries.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

In-app purchases have become a thorny issue for customers in Apple’s ecosystem. Earlier this year, Cupertino <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2087844/apple-ftc-settle-over-in-app-purchases-by-minors.html">settled with the United States Federal Trade Commission</a> over incidents where minors made in-app purchases—in some cases exorbitant ones—without the knowledge of their parents.</p><p>
But if you (or someone you know) has been bitten by one of these inadvertent purchases, how can you go about recouping your money? If visions of paperwork and annoying forms are swimming before your eyes, don’t sweat it: Apple’s made it pretty easy to put in your request without even leaving your computer.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2140066/how-to-get-an-app-store-refund-for-kids-accidental-in-app-purchases.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

When considering a portable drive, there are a few things to keep in mind. First portable drives rarely ever have <a href="http://www.techopedia.com/definition/18707/data-redundancy">data redundancy</a>, so don't use them to store sensitive or irreplacable information, or at least make sure the data on the portable drive is backed up. Consider your use: if you're backing up your Mac on the go you don't need super speed, but if you're going to be working directly off the drive you might want to sacrafice speed for capacity. And, of course, there's also price to consider.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2109122/the-best-portable-hard-drives.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>

      <title>How to share presentations in Messages</title>

Reader Keith White has a concern regarding remote presentations. He writes:</p><blockquote>
<em>I’m giving a presentation to a remote group next week and, as in the past, I was going to use Messages to do that. Now that I’m running Mavericks it doesn’t seem to work. What am I doing wrong?</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
The glib answer is “You’re running Mavericks.” The less glib answer is that Messages’ iChat Theater feature is gone in the Mavericks version.</p><p>
For the “Wait, what?” crowd, allow me to explain. In iChat and then later in Messages prior to Mavericks, you could share a Keynote presentation simply by having a copy of Keynote on your Mac, engaging in a video chat (both parties had to be on the same service—AIM, Jabber, Bonjour, but not iCloud), and then dragging a Keynote file into the bottom half of the video chat window. This would cause the presentation to appear on the other person’s Mac, with a small video window of the presenter. Under Mavericks if you attempt to do this you’ll see that you have the option to only send the file to the person on the other end.</p><p class="jumpTag"><a href="/article/2140003/how-to-share-presentations-in-messages.html#jump">To read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here</a></p></section></article>]]></description>
